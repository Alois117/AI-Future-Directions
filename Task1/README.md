## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

1. Convert model to TensorFlow Lite:
    ```python
    converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
    tflite_model = converter.convert()
    ```

2. Save the model:
    ```python
    with open("recyclenet_model.tflite", "wb") as f:
        f.write(tflite_model)
    ```

3. Deploy the `.tflite` file to a compatible device (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Android app).
